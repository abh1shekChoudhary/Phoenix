# Phoenix v2

Phoenix v2 is a policy-driven, environment-aware, autonomous failure
diagnosis and remediation system.

Core principles:
- Classification before action
- Decision before mutation
- Tests before merge
- Human authority over AI
- Context is discovered, not assumed

Phoenix v2 is NOT a code-fixing bot.
It is a controlled reliability system.
